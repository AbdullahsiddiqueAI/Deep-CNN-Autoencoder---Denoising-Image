
# Autoencoder for Image Denoising
# Introduction
An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning technique for neural networks that learns efficient data representations (encoding) by training the network to ignore signal noise. Autoencoders can be used for image denoising, image compression, and, in some cases, even generation of image data.

# Flow of Autoencoder
The flow of an autoencoder typically involves the following steps:

Noisy Image: Input image with added noise.
Encoder: The encoder network compresses the noisy image into a lower-dimensional representation.
Compressed Representation: The compressed, lower-dimensional representation of the image.
Decoder: The decoder network reconstructs the clear image from the compressed representation.
Reconstruct Clear Image: The output is a denoised image, similar to the original input image.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images.

# Data Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset
The MNIST dataset is loaded using the keras.datasets.mnist module. The images are normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1. The dataset is then reshaped to include a single channel.

# Adding Noise to the Images
Noise is added to the images to create noisy versions of the training and testing data. This noise is generated using a Gaussian distribution and added to the original images. The noisy images are then clipped to ensure pixel values remain in the range [0, 1].

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Random samples from the dataset are visualized to understand the effect of noise addition on the images.

# Model Building
# Model Architecture
The model architecture is built using a sequential convolutional neural network (CNN). It includes the following layers:

# Encoder Network:

Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
MaxPooling2D(2, padding='same')
Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
MaxPooling2D(2, padding='same')
Decoder Network:

Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
UpSampling2D(2)
Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
UpSampling2D(2)
Conv2D(1, 3, activation='sigmoid', padding='same')
Compiling the Model
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The model summary is generated to understand the architecture.

Training the Model
The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 256 using the noisy training images as input and the original images as output. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training.

# Model Evaluation
The trained model is used to predict the denoised images from the noisy test images. The results are visualized by comparing the noisy input images with the denoised output images.

# Visualize the Results
Random samples from the test dataset are visualized to compare the noisy input images with the reconstructed denoised images. This helps to understand the effectiveness of the autoencoder in removing noise from the images.

# Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the process of building, training, and evaluating an autoencoder model for image denoising. The autoencoder effectively learns to remove noise from the images, resulting in clear, denoised outputs.
